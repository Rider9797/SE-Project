Instructions for installing and starting a Redis server using WSL on Windows:

1. **Open your Command Prompt (CMD) and enter WSL**  
   Type the following command to open your WSL terminal:
   ```sh
   wsl
   ```

2. **Update Package Lists and Install Redis**  
   Run the following commands in your WSL terminal:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install redis-server -y
   ```
   - **Note:** If you see an error like  
     `E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem`,  
     then run:
     ```sh
     sudo dpkg --configure -a
     ```
     After that, re-run:
     ```sh
     sudo apt update && sudo apt install redis-server -y
     ```

3. **Start the Redis Server**  
   Once installation is complete, start the Redis server with:
   ```sh
   sudo service redis-server start
   ```

4. **Verify the Redis Server is Running**  
   Check the connection by running:
   ```sh
   redis-cli ping
   ```
   - If everything is working, you should see:
     ```
     PONG
     ```
